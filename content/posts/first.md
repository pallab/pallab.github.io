The title of this article came with the theme for this hugo site the hugo winston theme.
But it's an important reminder, particularly for the ones like me who are just starting to write that it takes time to write well. It takes time to get into the habit of writing, to develop taste and style and to refine a single piece of writing. 

I have never written anything beyond answers to questions in the exams I appeared, few longish letters to my school girlfiend( I hope she has burned it all ) and a very few articles in the school magazine under immense pressure from my teachers. I grew up very shy and timid, scared of expressing my thoughts and emotions. It had effects on my career, personal relations and probably have cost me many opportunities in all walks of life. 

This is why I am starting this blog. This is my way of speaking in public but from a quite corner of the internet which no one probably will find out. Hopefully by the time I write anything worth reading by other people I'll master the courage to face the consequences as well. 

Another very important reason for starting this is a realisation I have come to over the last few years. I think wrtiting helps one think in a structured way which helps one develop a well rounded understanding of the topic. My own inability to write has in a way stunted my intellectual growth. 

I just hope unlike my previous attempts at blogging, this time really do succeed.
